_Last updated: August 7, 2025_

CampusNav ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by the CampusNav mobile application (the "App").

By using CampusNav, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. User-Generated Content
- When you post events or contribute content within the app, that content is stored on our servers and may be visible to other users, depending on your college-specific settings.
- We retain this data to operate features like event sharing and campus activity feeds.

### b. Device Information
We may collect limited device information (such as device type and operating system version) to ensure compatibility and improve performance.

### c. College Configuration Data
Upon onboarding, the app stores your selected college (e.g., "UTAustin") in `UserDefaults`. This is used to load configuration data such as campus map, accent colors, and navigation nodes relevant to your school.

### d. Location Data
If granted permission, we use your real-time location to provide navigation assistance within campus boundaries. This location data:
- Is used only while the app is open and actively navigating
- Is not stored or transmitted to any external servers

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:
- Display campus-specific navigation and content
- Enable features such as location-based navigation and user-posted events
- Improve the functionality and user experience of the app

We do **not**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use your information for advertising or profiling
- Track users across apps or websites

## 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do **not** use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs at this time. If we integrate with any such services in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.

User-generated content (like events) may be visible to other app users depending on your schoolâ€™s configuration but is not shared with external services.

---

## 4. Data Retention

- Event posts and profile data are stored until deleted by the user or deemed inactive.
