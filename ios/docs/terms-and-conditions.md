# Terms and Conditions

_Last updated: August 6, 2025_

Welcome to **CampusNav**, a navigation tool designed to help users find locations and events across campus with ease. By using CampusNav, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before using the app.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using CampusNav, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with any part of the terms, you may not use the app.

## 2. Use of Location Services

CampusNav relies on **location data** to function properly. We use your location to:

- Display your current position on the map
- Provide real-time navigation and routing
- Offer relevant campus-based event information near you

Your location data is **never stored on our servers** and is only used locally on your device to enhance functionality.

You may disable location access at any time through your device settings, but doing so may limit the core functionality of the app.

## 3. User-Generated Content

CampusNav allows users to create content in the form of **events** (e.g., "Study Session @ Library"). By submitting an event, you agree that:

- The content must be appropriate, respectful, and relevant to campus life.
- The event must not contain offensive, harmful, or illegal material.
- You do not impersonate others or misrepresent event details.

All submitted events are reviewed and monitored by the CampusNav team and are stored in a **separate backend database** managed by us.

We reserve the right to **remove or modify any event** that violates these guidelines or is reported by other users.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Privacy

CampusNav does **not require an account** to use. We do not collect personal identifiers such as names, emails, or device IDs.

The only data stored on your device is via **UserDefaults**, which may include:

- User preferences (e.g., dark mode setting)
- Onboarding completion status
- Recently viewed locations or filters

This data is **not shared or transmitted** externally and remains on your device.
