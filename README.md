## Tech Stack
- **UI Elements:** SwiftUI is the frontend of this application, with custom-built views to provide the user with a tailored experience found nowhere else
- **Navigation:** Originally written in C and later translated to Swift, CampusNav uses the A* routing algorithm on a custom graph of connected nodes and paths with straight line distance as the heuristic to allow for a custom routing experience that can cut through buildings, and around backpaths found only here
- **Database:** Firebase is used as the backend database for this app, responsible for hosting user-created events to get users accurate information in real time
